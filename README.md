# Data-Preparation-and-Analysis-unsig-R

This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for preparing and analyzing a dataset related to caesarian section decision-making. The dataset includes attributes like age, delivery details, blood pressure, and heart problems for 83 pregnant women. The project focuses on enhancing data quality, exploring patterns, and preparing the dataset for predictive modeling.

## Key Features

### Data Preparation Workflow
1. **Data Import:**
   - Load the dataset using Python's `read.csv()` function.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze dataset size, structure, and key variables.
   - Identify patterns and relationships.
3. **Handling Missing Data:**
   - Detect and visualize missing values.
   - Apply techniques such as imputation or removal.
4. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Remove duplicate rows and verify changes.
   - Handle invalid data using imputation methods.
5. **Data Type Conversion:**
   - Ensure attributes have appropriate data types (e.g., converting strings to numerics).

### Advanced Data Processing
6. **Outlier Detection and Handling:**
   - Use Interquartile Range (IQR) to identify and address outliers.
7. **Balancing the Dataset:**
   - Use oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation for class balancing.
8. **Normalization:**
   - Scale numerical data to a common range (0-1).
9. **Categorical Transformation:**
   - Convert continuous attributes into categorical ones (e.g., age groups).
10. **Data Filtering:**
    - Focus analysis on subsets of data based on specific criteria.

### Statistical Analysis
- Calculate and visualize mean, median, and mode.
- Use graphical representations to explore central tendencies and distributions.
